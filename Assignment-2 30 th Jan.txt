1. Write a program to accept percentage from the user and display the grade according to the following 
   criteria: 

 Marks        Grade 
>90             A 
>80 and <=90    B 
>=60 and <=80   C 
below 60        D 


percentage=int(input())

if percentage>90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif 80<percentage<=90:
    print("Grade: B")
elif 60<=percentage<=80:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: D")


2.  Write a program to accept the cost price of a bike and display the road tax to be paid according to the 
    following criteria: 

Tax    Cost Price(in Rs)
15%       >100000 
10%     50000 and <= 100000
5%         <= 50000 
 

Cost_Price=int(input())
if Cost_Price>100000:
    print("Total tax to be paid of Rupees: ",Cost_Price*0.15)
elif Cost_Price>50000 and Cost_Price<=100000:
    print("Total tax to be paid of Rupees: ",Cost_Price*0.10)
else:
    print("Total tax to be paid of Rupees: ",Cost_Price*0.05)


3. Accept any city from the user and display monuments of that city.
 
City     Monument 
Delhi    Red Fort 
Agra     Taj Mahal
Jaipur   Jal Mahal
 

City=input()
if City=='Delhi':
    print(f'The Monument of {City} is Red Fort')
elif City=='Agra':
    print(f'The Monument of {City} is Taj Mahal')
elif City=='Jaipur':
    print(f'The Monument of {City} is Jal Mahal')
else:
    pass

4. Check how many times a given number can be divided by 3 before it is less than or equal to 10. 

n=int(input())
c=0
while n<=10:
    if n%3==0:
        c+=1
    n+=1
print(c)



5. Why and When to Use while Loop in Python give a detailed description with example 

:- A "While" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unknown number of times, until a condition is met.
   
count = 1
while (count <=10):
    print 'The count is:', count
    count = count + 1
print "Good bye!"
   
The block above, consisting of the print and increment statements, is executed repeatedly until count is no longer less than or equal to 10.
With each iteration, the current value of the index count is displayed and then increased by 1.


6. Use nested while loop to print 3 different pattern. 

a.

n=int(input())
i=1
while i<=n:
    j=1
    while j<=i:
        print('*',end=" ")
        j=j+1
    print()
    i=i+1

b.

n=int(input())
i=1
while i<=n:
    print(" "*(n-i)+"*"*i)
    i=i+1

c.

n=int(input())
i=1
while i<=n:
    print("*"*n)
    i=i+1



7.  Reverse a while loop to display numbers from 10 to 1. 

i=10
while i>0:
    print(i)
    i=i-1
